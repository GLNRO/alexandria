# Alexandria

### The Decentralized Library
Alexandria is a PoC application comprised of a react client, node server (Go to come...), with all assets stored on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/).

### Running Locally
```
docker-compose up
```
The application runs across three different containers. The client and server run in their own containers, as does the ipfs node.


### Development
